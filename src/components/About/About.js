              With each project, the goal is to improve upon previous ones to ensure a better engaging experience for the end-user. On a recent project, I worked with a team of four to develop a MERN app for users and teams to manage and track various projects and tasks with over 170 personal commits within a month. Iâ€™m hoping to utilize my skill set with a future team to build better experiences on the web.
